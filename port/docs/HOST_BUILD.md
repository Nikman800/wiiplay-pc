# Host build: the loader harnesses, the big-endian field wrapper and pointer slots

Status (2026-10-30): the first pieces of the game that run natively on a PC are the disc load
path, the font loader, the message loader, TPL binding and the layout loader (`nw4r::lyt`
build and animation binding, no drawing yet).

- The decompiled Yaz0 decoder and U8 archive code, compiled with GCC for Linux x86-64, open every
  archive on the player's disc and read every file inside. The result matches
  `port/assets/tools/wiiarc.py` byte for byte.
- The real `nw4r::ut::ResFont` relocates every `.brfnt` on the disc in place (including the HOME
  Menu fonts inside layout archives) and answers glyph lookups for every code point exactly as an
  independent Python decoder does.
- The real `RPSysMessage` / `EGG::MsgRes` reads both BMG files with a 16-bit `wchar_t`.
- `TPLBind` relocates every `.tpl` on the disc (471, all inside layout archives) in place with
  M0 addresses, and `lyt::TexMap` reads them back.
- The real `lyt::Layout::Build` builds all 140 `.brlyt` files on the disc (4120 panes, 2633
  materials, 207 groups), and every `.brlan` (604) is bound to every layout of its archive
  through `Layout::CreateAnimTransform` / `AnimTransformBasic` (4248 binds). Everything matches
  an independent decoding with `port/assets/tools/fmt_layout.py` (§1, the layout harness).

`POINTERS.md` steps 0 to 4 are implemented: M0 (emulated Wii addresses for all host heap memory),
`RES_PTR(T)` slots, `-fshort-wchar` with the MSL_C wide functions, ResFont (§5 to §7 below), TPL
and the layout resource structs (§9), and the two hard-coded runtime offsets (§10).

## 1. Build and run

Requirements: GCC/G++ (tested with 15.2), GNU make and Python 3. CMake is not needed. The
32-bit cross-check also needs gcc-multilib and g++-multilib.

```sh
cd port/host
make                       # 64-bit (primary): build/host64/{arc_harness,res_harness,lyt_harness,test_*}
make test                  # unit tests + archive and resource comparisons (DISC defaults to ~/wii-play/extracted/files)
make test DISC=/path/to/extracted/files
make M32=1 test            # same code built with -m32 into build/host32 (cross-check)
make clean
```

Expected `make test` output (`make M32=1 test` prints the same with pointer size 4):

```
test_be (C++): OK
test_be (C): OK
test_port: OK (pointer size 8, wchar_t 2)
test_port (C): OK
test_layout: OK (static_asserts, pointer size 8)
arc_harness: 59 disc files, 62 archives, 1615 leaf files, 0 errors (pointer size 8)
disc files: 59 (.carc: 31, opened by the harness: 31)
archives mounted: harness 62, wiiarc 62 (disc-level 31, nested 31)
leaf files: harness 1615, wiiarc 1615
nw4r headers checked: 935
missing 0, extra 0, mismatched 0
OK
res_harness: 8 fonts (1983 glyph lines), 2 BMG files (714 messages), 0 errors (pointer size 8, wchar_t 2)
files: BRFNT 8, BMG 2
lines: F 8/8, C 8/8, W 8/8, G 1983/1983, A 8/8, M 714/714 (harness/python)

OK
lyt_harness: 471 TPL files (443 already bound by a layout), 140 layouts (4120 panes), 604 animations (4248 binds, 8086 bound contents), 0 errors (pointer size 8)
files: TPL 471, BRLYT 140, BRLAN 604
lines: T 471/471, TD 472/472, L 140/140, P 4120/4120, M 2633/2633, G 207/207, A 4248/4248, AC 41949/41949 (harness/python)
missing 0, extra 0
OK
```

| Target | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `unit` | `test_be`, `test_be_c` (wrapper), `test_port`, `test_port_c` (M0 arena, `RES_PTR`, wide functions, C++ and C), `test_layout` (compile-time struct layout checks); also compiles the step 4 units (§10) |
| `archives` | `arc_harness` + `tests/test_archives.py` |
| `resources` | `res_harness` + `tests/test_resources.py` |
| `layouts` | `lyt_harness` + `tests/test_layouts.py` |

The harnesses take well under a second each. The Python reference walks take about 13 s
(archives, which hashes every file), 3 s (resources) and 3 s (layouts). Nothing is written to disk except the
build directory, which is ignored by git. Disc data never leaves the extracted folder.

### What the harness does

`tests/disc_walk.h` (shared by both harnesses) loads each disc file the way `RPSysResourceManager::LoadFromDVD` and
`ExpandCompressed` do. Everything named below is the real decompiled code, compiled unmodified
unless §4 lists it:

| Step | Code |
|---|---|
| open and read | `EGG::DvdFile::open(path, multiHandle)`, `EGG::DvdRipper::loadToMainRAM` (`src/egg/core/eggDvdFile.cpp`, `eggDvdRipper.cpp`) |
| decompress | `EGG::Decomp::checkCompressed`, `getExpandSize`, `decode` (`src/egg/core/eggDecomp.cpp`) |
| mount | `EGG::Archive::mount`, `getFile`, the archive list, `~Archive` (`src/egg/core/eggArchive.cpp`, `eggDisposer.cpp`, `src/nw4r/ut/ut_list.cpp`) |
| list and look up | `ARCInitHandle`, `ARCOpenDir`, `ARCReadDir`, `ARCOpen`, `ARCFastOpen`, `ARCConvertPathToEntrynum`, `ARCGetStartAddrInMem` (`src/revolution/ARC/arc.c`) |
| nw4r header | `nw4r::ut::IsValidBinaryFile` on every file with an nw4r header (`src/nw4r/ut/ut_binaryFileFormat.cpp`) |
| asserts | `system_halt` and `system_print` (`src/egg/prim/eggAssert.cpp`) |

For each file it calls `Archive::getFile` with the file's path, then cross-checks the result
against `ARCFastOpen` and `ARCConvertPathToEntrynum`. It descends into nested archives (Yaz0 or
U8 inside an archive) with the same rule as `wiiarc._expand`, and hands each leaf file to the
harness while its archive is still mounted. `tests/arc_harness.cpp` prints one line per archive
(path, node count) and one per leaf file (path, size, FNV-1a 64 hash, nw4r header fields read
through the wrapper).

`tests/test_archives.py` compares all of these with wiiarc.py:

- the sets of paths
- sizes and content hashes
- archive node counts
- nw4r header fields, against `struct.unpack(">4sHHIHH")`
- every `.carc` on the disc was mounted

The disc has 31 `.carc` files: 28 are archives with files in them and 3 are empty archives
(`Effect/RPCommonParty/effect.carc`, `Common/RPPartyTitle/common.carc`, `US/Kokeshi/local.carc`;
each is 39 bytes of Yaz0 holding a root-only U8). Inside them are 31 nested archives and 1615 leaf
files, including the 28 top-level non-archive disc files that are loaded through the same DVD
path.

### The resource harness (`tests/res_harness.cpp`)

For every leaf file that starts with `RFNT` or `MESG` (8 fonts and 2 message files on the US
disc, three of the fonts inside the HOME Menu layout archives
`US/PartyStatic/local.carc/HomeMenu/homeBtn_*.arc`):

- **Fonts.** `ResFont::SetResource` on the buffer. This runs `Rebuild`, which relocates the
  six offset slots in place (they become emulated Wii addresses, §5) and renames the file
  `RFNU`. For every code point 0 to 0xFFFF the harness then calls:
  - `SetAlternateChar(ch)`, which is `FindGlyphIndex(ch)` behind the public API; the index it
    finds is read back from `FontInformation.alterCharIndex` and the original restored;
  - `GetCharWidths(ch)`, `GetCharWidth(ch)` and `GetGlyph(&glyph, ch)`.

  It also loads the same buffer into a second `ResFont`, which takes the `RFNU` branch (the path
  `lyt::TextBox` takes for fonts in layout archives), and requires both fonts to agree on every
  code point, and every unmapped code point to give the alternate glyph. It prints the font
  metrics from the `ResFontBase` getters, the relocated slots as file offsets, the CMAP and CWDH
  chains as the decomp follows them, and one line per mapped code point.
- **Messages.** `PortSwapBmgText` (§6), then `RPSysMessage` (the game's loader; it derives from
  `EGG::MsgRes`). `src/Pack/RPKernel/RPSysMessage.cpp` is compiled unmodified through
  `tests/rpsysmessage_unit.cpp`, which supplies the include guard of the `Pack/RPKernel.h`
  umbrella header (most of RPKernel does not build on the host yet). For each MID1 entry the
  harness splits the id as `getMsgEntry` does, calls `GetMsgEntry`, `GetAttribute`, `GetScale`,
  `GetCharSpace` and `GetMsg`, walks the text with `MsgRes::analyzeTag`, and calls `wcslen`
  (the MSL_C version).

`tests/test_resources.py` builds the same lines from `port/assets/tools/fmt_text_font.py`: the
`BrfntFont` class (CMAP/CWDH chains from FINF, first matching map decides, dictionary lookup for
scan maps, cell and sheet arithmetic from TGLP) and `bmg_messages()` (id split per MID1 form
supplement, first INF1 entry with the same id, code units and tags read from the UTF-16BE bytes).
Both are written from the file format, not translated from the decompiled readers.

`fmt_text_font.py` used to report 5 of the 8 fonts as broken ("CMAP pNext does not point to a
CMAP payload"). The parser was wrong: it unpacked the CMAP header as `>HHHI`, which reads
`pNext` at payload +0x6 instead of +0x8 (it dropped the reserved `u16`), and it treated `pNext`
as relative to the current block, whereas `Rebuild` resolves it from the start of the file. It
also read direct maps' base index from +0x8 instead of +0xC. All 8 fonts parse now; the report is
`port/assets/formats/text_font.report.txt`.

### The layout harness (`tests/lyt_harness.cpp`)

For every mounted archive with a `blyt` directory (at the root, as in the game's layout
archives, or under `arc/`, as in the HOME Menu archives) it attaches a real
`lyt::ArcResourceAccessor` (root `""` or `"arc"`; the game passes `""`,
`RPSysLytResAccessor::mountArchive`), then for every `.brlyt`:

- `Layout::Build`: panes, pictures, text boxes (fonts from the archive through `ResFont`),
  windows, boundings, groups and materials. Each material fetches its `timg/*.tpl` and calls
  `TexMap::Set(TPLPalette*, 0)`, which runs `TPLBind` (§9) the first time.
- It prints the pane tree depth-first (kind from `ut::DynamicCast`, name, user data, visibility,
  alpha, base position, translate/rotate/scale/size, material; text length, hash, font,
  font size, spacing and colours for text boxes; vertex colours; window frame materials), every
  material (TEV colours and constant colours, texture SRT 0, every texture's TPL size, format
  and wrap modes through `TexMap`), and every group with its panes.
- For every `.brlan` of the same archive: `Layout::CreateAnimTransform` and
  `Layout::BindAnimation`. It prints `GetFrameSize`, `IsLoopData`, and for each animation
  content whether `AnimTransformBasic::Bind` linked it to a pane or material.

Layouts are allocated through `Layout::SetAllocator` with an `MEMAllocator` whose functions call
the M0 arena. For every `.tpl` leaf it calls `TPLBind` itself unless a layout already bound it
(the "already bound" test of `TexMap::Set`, which therefore runs on both branches: 443 palettes
are bound by layouts first, 28 by the harness), and reads every descriptor back through `TPLGet`
and `lyt::TexMap::Set(TPLPalette*, id)`, which must agree.

`tests/test_layouts.py` builds the same lines from `port/assets/tools/fmt_layout.py` (imported
read-only; BRLYT, BRLAN and TPL decoded from the file format) and `wiiarc.py`. The rules that
decide a line (block nesting, `grp1` depth 1 only, the `GX_MAX_TEXMAP` and `MAX_TEX_SRT`
clamps, the text buffer length, name matching for binding) are written out from the format.
One `fmt_layout.py` bug turned up: `parse_string_list` resolves `txl1`/`fnl1` name offsets
from the block start, but they are relative to the first entry (block + 12, as
`Material` and `TextBox` resolve them), so its `name` fields are empty or wrong; the test
reads the names itself.

### Host stand-ins (`src/host_sdk.cpp`, `src/host_arena.cpp`, `src/host_text.cpp`, `src/host_tpl.cpp`, `src/host_gx.cpp`)

These are deliberately minimal and synchronous. The Phase 7 platform layer replaces them.

- **OS**:
  - mutexes are no-ops; message queues are single-threaded ring buffers
  - `OSGetCurrentThread` returns a static thread
  - `OSReport` prints to stderr; `OSPanic` aborts
- **DVD**:
  - paths resolve against the disc root
  - an entry number indexes a table of opened paths
  - `DVDFileInfo.block.userData` holds the host `FILE*` (a runtime struct, so a 64-bit pointer is
    fine there)
  - reads past the end of a file return zeros (callers round sizes up to 32)
  - the async read calls its callback before returning
- **EGG heap**:
  - `Heap::alloc`/`free` and the global and heap `operator new`/`delete` allocate from the M0
    arena (§5): a first-fit, address-ordered free list with coalescing, MEM2 first, then MEM1.
    Any power-of-two alignment is honoured (the sign of the alignment, head or tail, is ignored)
  - `Heap::findContainHeap` returns NULL, so disposers are not attached to heaps
- **OS addresses**: `port/host/include/revolution/OS/OSAddress.h` shadows the SDK header.
  `OSPhysicalToCached`/`Uncached` decode an address through M0; `OSCachedToPhysical` returns the
  physical address as a `u32` (`vaddr & 0x3FFFFFFF`). On the Wii it returns a pointer that every
  caller casts to `u32`.
- **Text**: `PortSwapBmgText` (§6).
- **TPL**: `TPLBind` / `TPLGet` (§9).
- **GX**: every GX call that `lyt` and `ut::CharWriter` link is a no-op (`src/host_gx.cpp`).
- **MTX**: `PSMTXCopy`, `Concat`, `Scale`, `TransApply` and `RotRad` in plain C++ (the decomp's
  versions are paired-single assembly).
- **MEM**: `MEMAllocFromAllocator` / `MEMFreeToAllocator` dispatch through the allocator's
  function table, as `src/revolution/MEM/mem_allocator.c` does.
- **VI, DC**: no-ops.

## 2. The big-endian field wrapper

### Use

Declare members that map onto file bytes with these types. They have the same size and alignment
as the plain type, so offsets do not change:

| Type | Field |
|---|---|
| `be_u16`, `be_s16`, `be_u32`, `be_s32`, `be_f32` | integer and float fields |
| `be_u64`, `be_s64`, `be_f64` | 64-bit fields (C++ only) |
| `BE_ENUM(E, Storage)` | a member the original declares as enum `E`, stored as the integer `Storage` (u8, u16 or u32) |
| `be_u24` | 3-byte field, alignment 1 (host only; U8 node name offsets) |

- **C++.** `be<T>` converts implicitly to `T`, and assigning a `T` stores big-endian, so the
  decompiled code compiles unchanged: `pHeader->fileSize < x`, `hdr->signature = 'RFNU'`,
  `flags |= 2`, `++count`. Only the type declarations change.
- **C.** C has no operator overloading, so C code reads with `BE_GET(field)` and writes with
  `BE_SET(field, value)`. On the host the C types are one-member structs, so a forgotten
  `BE_GET` is a compile error rather than a silent wrong value.
- **Both languages.** `BE_GET` and `BE_SET` also work in C++.
- **Raw bytes.** `port_load_be16/32/64` and `port_store_be16/32/64` read and write big-endian at
  any address, aligned or not. Use them for code that walks bytes without a struct.

Rules:

- **Leave payloads alone.** Do not wrap fields that GX consumes: display lists, vertex arrays,
  texture and palette data stay big-endian bytes for the Phase 7 GX layer (ASSETS.md §3.1). Wrap
  only what the CPU reads.
- **Keep `NW4R_LITTLE_ENDIAN` undefined on the host.** With the wrapper, the CPU reads the
  file's `0xFEFF` byte-order mark as `0xFEFF`, which is `NW4R_BYTEORDER_BIG`, the value
  `IsValidBinaryFile` expects.
- **Avoid double swaps in `snd`.** `snd::Util::ReadBigEndian` has its own little-endian branch,
  under the misspelled macro `NW4R_LITLE_ENDIAN`. When `snd` structs move to `be_*`, either
  leave that macro undefined or keep those fields plain. Do not do both, or the value is swapped
  twice.
- **Pointer slots inside files** need a different type: `RES_PTR(T)`, §5.
- **Explicit conversions.** `be<T>`'s constructor from `T` is `explicit`, so `cond ? u16 : be_u16`
  is not ambiguous (`ResFontBase::GetGlyphIndex` has one); assignment still takes a plain `T`.
  `static_cast<SomeEnum>(field)` works through an explicit conversion to enum types
  (`static_cast<GXTexFmt>(sheetFormat)`).

### Implementation

| Build | Header | What the names are |
|---|---|---|
| Host (`PORT_HOST` defined) | `port/host/include/port/be.h` | C++: `template <class T, class Storage = T> class port::be` holds one `alignas(Storage)` unsigned integer of the same size and byte-swaps on `get`/`set` (`__builtin_bswap*`, or `_byteswap_*` on MSVC; no swap on a big-endian host). `static_assert` checks size, alignment, trivial copyability and standard layout. C: `typedef struct { u32 raw_; } be_u32;` and so on, with `BE_GET`/`BE_SET` dispatched by C11 `_Generic`. `PORT_BE_WRAPPED` is 1. |
| Wii (matching) | `include/port/be.h` | Each name is a macro for the plain type (`#define be_u32 u32`). `BE_GET(x)` is `(x)` and `BE_SET(f, v)` is `((f) = (v))`. `BE_ENUM(E, S)` is `E`. `PORT_BE_WRAPPED` is 0. |

### How it stays out of the matching build

- **Include-path order selects the header; no flag is involved.** The host Makefile puts
  `port/host/include` before `include/`. CodeWarrior only searches `include/`, so it finds the
  Wii version. Each header `#error`s if it is reached from the wrong build.
- **What the edited lines become on the Wii.** The edited type declarations expand to the same
  tokens as before, and the `BE_GET` wraps add only parentheses. In a few places a type change
  could not be expressed as a macro (for example, U8 node names are a 24-bit bitfield on the
  Wii). There the original code sits under `#if PORT_BE_WRAPPED ... #else ... #endif` or
  `#if defined(PORT_HOST)` and is unchanged.
- **Machine check: `port/host/tools/check_matching.py`.**
  - It finds every unit that depends on a touched file, using the decomp checkout's
    `ninja -t deps` (read-only).
  - It recompiles each one from this repository with the exact CodeWarrior command line from
    the decomp's `build.ninja`, writing to a temporary directory.
  - It compares each object byte for byte with the decomp checkout's object.
  - It skips a unit when any of its other dependencies differs between the two checkouts.
- **Result on 2026-10-30, after the TPL, layout and step 4 changes.** All 734 units that
  depend on the touched files (§4; the list is `TOUCHED` in the script, 34 files) are
  byte-identical, and none were skipped. They include every `nw4r/lyt` unit,
  `RPPlayerNameTag.o` and the unlinked `RPSysTagProcessor.o` (identical to the decomp's object,
  so its 4 differences from the target are unchanged). Run it after every change to a decomp file:

  ```sh
  python3 port/host/tools/check_matching.py --decomp ~/wii-play -j 16    # ~1 min
  ```

### Other host-only overrides

All of these live in `port/host/include`, which shadows `include/` on the host only.

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `types.h` | `u32`/`s32` come from `<stdint.h>`. The original uses `unsigned long`, which is 8 bytes on LP64 and would change every struct layout. Also: `ROUND_UP_PTR`/`ROUND_DOWN_PTR` through `uintptr_t`; `DECL_HW_REGS` becomes a weak fake register array; `<cfloat>` for `FLT_EPSILON`. |
| `decomp/compat.h` | The CodeWarrior syntax shims, without the parser-only `0` placeholders. Defines `COMPAT_ANY`, so `DECOMP_FORCEACTIVE` and the other matching hacks compile away. |
| `revolution/OS/__ppc_eabi_init.h` | Emptied: PowerPC boot hooks and linker section symbols, and an `exit(void)` that conflicts with libc. |
| `port/be.h`, `port/host.h` | The wrapper; `PortHostSetDiscRoot`, `PortSwapBmgText`. |
| `port/arena.h`, `port/resptr.h`, `port/wide.h` | M0, `RES_PTR`, 16-bit `wchar_t` (§5, §6). |
| `revolution/OS/OSAddress.h` | Physical/cached conversions through M0 (§1, host stand-ins). |
| `revolution/TPL/TPL.h` | The TPL structs with `be_*`, `BE_ENUM` and `RES_PTR` members (§9). |

`types.h` also defines `std::stricmp` (MSL has it; `ArcResourceAccessor`'s name lookup uses it)
as `strcasecmp`, and `port/wide.h` adds `std::` using-declarations for the `port_wcs*`
functions so `std::wcslen` resolves after the renaming macros.

Build flags: `-DPORT_HOST=1 -DNONMATCHING -DREVOLUTION -DNDEBUG=1 -DVERSION_RHAE01
-DVERSION_RHAE01_01`, `-std=gnu++17 -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti` (C: `-std=gnu11`),
`-fshort-wchar -include port/wide.h`, `-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast` (C also
`-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast`). CodeWarrior's recursive `-ir include/revolution/BTE` and
`-ir include/egg` become one `-idirafter` per subdirectory, and its `-i include/nw4r` and
`-i include/Pack` become `-idirafter` too (EGG and game headers include siblings by bare name).
The MSL_C wide-string units are built with `-DPORT_WIDE_IMPL -idirafter include/MSL`.

## 3. 64-bit

Native 64-bit is the primary target. The `-m32` build is a cross-check: a bug that shows up only
in 64-bit is a pointer-size problem, and one that shows up in both is an endianness problem. Both
builds pass the full test.

### Pointer-size problems on this load path

All of these are compile errors or truncations in 64-bit only; none is a problem in `-m32`:

| Site | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `include/types.h` | `u32`/`s32` are `unsigned long`/`long`, which are 8 bytes on LP64 | host `types.h` (§2) |
| `include/macros.h` `ROUND_UP_PTR`, `ROUND_DOWN_PTR` | cast the pointer through `u32`. `DvdRipper::loadToMainRAM` uses `ROUND_UP_PTR` for its 32-byte chunk when the offset is non-zero | host `types.h` redefines both through `uintptr_t` |
| `include/nw4r/ut/ut_algorithm.h` `GetIntPtr` | `reinterpret_cast<u32>(ptr)`. It is the basis of `AddOffsetToPtr`, `GetOffsetFromPtr` and `ComparePtr`, which every nw4r resource accessor uses | `#if defined(PORT_HOST)`: returns `uintptr_t` |
| `src/egg/core/eggDvdFile.cpp` `DvdFile::sync` | `reinterpret_cast<s32>(OSMessage)`: the DVD result travels through a message queue as a `void*` | `#if defined(PORT_HOST)`: cast through `intptr_t` |
| `include/revolution/OS/OSAddress.h` | `OSPhysicalToCached`/`Uncached` turn a `u32` into a pointer | host shadow header through M0 (§1 host stand-ins); `-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast` is gone and the cast is now an error everywhere |

### Pointer slots inside files

There are none on the archive path:

- **U8 nodes** hold offsets and indices, never pointers.
- **`ARCHandle`** is a runtime struct and stores native pointers.
- **`EGG::Archive`** and **`DVDFileInfo`** are also runtime structs, so their larger 64-bit
  layout does not matter.

The 4-byte pointer slots that do bite are in the formats that relocate in place. These are TPL,
`ut::ResFont`, `ef`, g3d texture binding, PMP and the KCL header copy (ASSETS.md §3.1 item 3).
They are inventoried in `port/docs/POINTERS.md`. `RES_PTR(T)` (§5) sits beside `be_*` with the
same Wii/host header split; ResFont is the first user.

One layout trap the wrapper avoids: a byte array like `u8[4]` would have alignment 1 and would
shift every field after a `u8`. `be<T>` stores an `alignas(T)` integer, so it keeps the Wii
offsets. The unit test checks this with `offsetof`.

## 4. Decomp files touched

Every change is minimal and either produces the same tokens for CodeWarrior or is guarded. The
check in §2 confirms all of them.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `include/port/be.h` | **New.** The Wii side of the wrapper: macros for the plain types. |
| `include/port/resptr.h` | **New.** The Wii side of `RES_PTR`: `RES_PTR(T)` is `T*`, the cast macros are the casts they replace (§5). |
| `src/revolution/ARC/arc.c` | `#include <port/be.h>`. `ARCHeader` and `ARCNode` fields are declared `be_u32`/`be_s32`. The node's `is_folder:8`/`name:24` bitfield is under `#if PORT_BE_WRAPPED` (host: `u8 is_folder; be_u24 name;`). All 18 direct field reads, and the two `ARCNodeIsFolder`/`ARCNodeGetName` macros, are wrapped in `BE_GET(...)`. |
| `include/nw4r/ut/ut_binaryFileFormat.h` | `#include <port/be.h>`. The `BinaryFileHeader` and `BinaryBlockHeader` members are `be_u32`/`be_u16`. This is the first C++ use: `IsValidBinaryFile` compiles unchanged and reads through the wrapper. |
| `include/nw4r/ut/ut_algorithm.h` | `GetIntPtr` returns `uintptr_t` under `#if defined(PORT_HOST)`. |
| `src/egg/core/eggDvdFile.cpp` | `DvdFile::sync` casts `OSMessage` to `s32` through `intptr_t` under `#if defined(PORT_HOST)`. |
| `include/nw4r/ut/ut_ResFontBase.h` | `#include <port/resptr.h>`. `FontTextureGlyph`, `FontWidth`, `FontCodeMap`, `FontInformation`: the `u16`/`u32` members are `be_u16`/`be_u32` (including `mapInfo[]`), and the six pointer members (`sheetImage`, both `pNext`, `pGlyph`, `pWidth`, `pMap`) are `RES_PTR(...)`. Type tokens only. |
| `src/nw4r/ut/ut_ResFont.cpp` | A host-only `ResolveOffset(port::res_ptr<T>&, void*)` overload under `#if defined(PORT_HOST)` (7 lines). `Rebuild` and its `ResolveOffset<T>(...)` calls are unchanged. |
| `src/nw4r/ut/ut_ResFontBase.cpp` | The local `CMapScanEntry` / `CMapInfoScan` members in `FindGlyphIndex` are `be_u16`. Type tokens only. |
| `include/nw4r/ut/ut_CharStrmReader.h` | `StepStrm` (`static_cast<const T*>(mCharStrm) += offset`, a CodeWarrior extension) is written as an assignment under `#if defined(PORT_HOST)`; needed by `ut_Font.cpp` / `ut_CharStrmReader.cpp`, which `ResFont` links. |
| `include/egg/util/eggMsgRes.h` | `#include <port/be.h>`. The BMG header, block, INF1 entry and MID1 numeric members are `be_u32`/`be_u16` (`mContent` of MID1 is `be_u32[]`). `wchar_t mContent[1]` (DAT1) is unchanged; `-fshort-wchar` gives it the Wii layout. |
| `src/egg/util/eggMsgRes.cpp` | Two `#if defined(PORT_HOST)` blocks: the block-bounds assert at `#line 77` compares `const u8*` instead of `(u32)` casts, and `analyzeTag` reads the tag id with `port_load_be32` (tag payloads stay big-endian, §6). The Wii branches are the original lines with the original `#line`. |
| `include/Pack/RPKernel/RPSysMessage.h` | `RPSysMessage::Entry::scale` is `be_u16`. |
| `include/nw4r/ut/ut_Color.h` | `#include <port/be.h>`. `ToU32ref()` returns `be_u32&` (and `operator=(const GXColor&)` reads through `be_u32`): the u32 form of a colour is `0xRRGGBBAA` on every host, so colours read from `be_u32` file fields (vertex and text colours) land in the right bytes. Type tokens only. |
| `include/nw4r/lyt/lyt_types.h` | `#include <port/be.h>`. `detail::TestBit` / `GetBits` overloads for `port::be<T, S>` under `#if PORT_BE_WRAPPED`. A `res` block after `TexSRT`: on the host the file value types `res::VEC2`, `VEC3`, `Size`, `GXColorS10`, `TexSRT` (big-endian members, each converting to the runtime type); on the Wii `typedef`s of `math::VEC2`, `math::VEC3` and `TexSRT` (`res::Size` and `res::GXColorS10` are host-only; on the Wii the unqualified names in `res` find the runtime types as before). |
| `include/nw4r/lyt/lyt_common.h` | Includes `lyt_types.h`. `res::TexCoord` (host: `res::VEC2[4]`, Wii: `typedef detail::TexCoord`). `GetSignatureInt` reads `be_s32`, `GetStrTableStr` reads a `be_u32` offset table. |
| `include/nw4r/lyt/lyt_resources.h` | `BinaryFileHeader`, `DataBlockHeader`, `Texture`, `Font`, the three list headers, `res::TexMap` and `MaterialResourceNum::bits`: `be_u16`/`be_u32`. |
| `include/nw4r/lyt/lyt_pane.h` | `res::Pane`: `math::VEC3`/`math::VEC2` → `VEC3`/`VEC2` (resolved in `res`; the same types on the Wii). |
| `include/nw4r/lyt/lyt_picture.h`, `lyt_textBox.h`, `lyt_group.h`, `lyt_animation.h` | `res::Picture`, `res::TextBox`, `res::Group`, `res::AnimationBlock`, `res::AnimationInfo`: integer and float members `be_*`. |
| `include/nw4r/lyt/lyt_window.h` | `res::WindowContent`, `WindowFrame`, `Window` members `be_*`; a host-only `res::InflationLRTB` under `#if PORT_BE_WRAPPED`. |
| `src/nw4r/lyt/lyt_animation.cpp` | `res::AnimationTarget`, `StepKey`, `HermiteKey` members `be_*`; the offset tables are read as `be_u32` (`ConvertOffsToPtr<be_u32>`, `const be_u32*`). |
| `src/nw4r/lyt/lyt_picture.cpp`, `lyt_textBox.cpp`, `lyt_window.cpp` | Material and frame offset tables read as `be_u32`. `lyt_textBox.cpp` also has one `#if defined(PORT_HOST)` block after `SetString` that converts the copied text from UTF-16BE (the file stays as it is). |
| `src/nw4r/lyt/lyt_material.cpp` | The texture SRTs in the file are read as `res::TexSRT` (3 lines). |
| `src/nw4r/lyt/lyt_common.cpp` | `TexCoordAry::Copy` reads `res::TexCoord`. |
| `src/nw4r/lyt/lyt_texMap.cpp` | `#include <port/resptr.h>`; the bound test `reinterpret_cast<u32>(descriptorArray) < 0x80000000` → `PORT_PTR_TO_U32(...)` (POINTERS.md §3.1). |
| `src/nw4r/lyt/lyt_arcResourceAccessor.cpp` | `GetResourceSub`'s `unsigned long* pSize` → `u32* pSize` (the declaration's type; `u32` is `unsigned long` on the Wii). |
| `src/Pack/RPKernel/RPSysTagProcessor.cpp` | §10. |
| `include/Pack/RPKernel/RPSysSystemWinMgr.h` | `friend class RPSysTagProcessor;` (§10). |
| `src/Pack/RPParty/RPPartyCommon/RPPlayerNameTag.cpp` | §10: an `#if defined(PORT_HOST)` include and an `#if defined(PORT_HOST)` argument. |

No other files under `src/` or `include/` were changed. Everything else is new and lives under
`port/host/`, `port/docs/` and `port/assets/`.

## 5. M0 and `RES_PTR(T)`

Design: `POINTERS.md` §2. Implementation:

- **M0, `port/host/include/port/arena.h`, `src/host_arena.cpp`.** `PortArenaInit` reserves
  `0x14000000` bytes with `mmap(PROT_NONE, MAP_NORESERVE)` and makes MEM1 (24 MiB at offset 0)
  and MEM2 (64 MiB at offset `0x10000000`) read/write; the gap stays inaccessible. The first
  `0x3100` bytes of MEM1 are never allocated, so address 0 means NULL. `port_vaddr(p)` is
  `0x80000000 + (p - base)` and `port_hptr(v)` the inverse; both are inline and abort with a
  message when the address is outside the block. `PortArenaAlloc`/`PortArenaFree` back every
  heap allocation and every `operator new` (§1), and initialise the arena on first use, so static
  constructors are covered. `PortArenaMEM1Lo/Hi` and `PortArenaMEM2Lo/Hi` give the bounds the
  Phase 7 `OSGetMEM*Arena*` will return.
- **M1, `include/port/resptr.h` (Wii) and `port/host/include/port/resptr.h` (host).**

  | Name | Wii | Host C++ | Host C |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `RES_PTR(T)` | `T*` | `port::res_ptr<T>`: one `be_u32`, 4 bytes, alignment 4, trivially copyable | `res_ptr_c` |
  | read | the member | implicit `operator T*()`, `->`, `[]` through the decoded pointer; `RES_PTR_GET(slot)` | `RES_PTR_GET(slot)` |
  | write | `slot = p` | `slot = p` (`operator=(T*)` stores `port_vaddr(p)` big-endian); `RES_PTR_SET` | `RES_PTR_SET(slot, p)` |
  | `slot != 0`, `== NULL` | pointer test | compares the raw u32, so it also works on an unrelocated offset | `RES_PTR_RAW(slot) != 0` |
  | `RES_PTR_RAW(slot)` | `reinterpret_cast<u32>(slot)` / `(u32)(slot)` | `slot.raw()`: the u32 in host order (offset before relocation, address after) | same |
  | `PORT_PTR_TO_U32(p)` | `reinterpret_cast<u32>(p)` / `(u32)(p)` | `port_vaddr(p)`; for a `res_ptr` argument its `raw()` | `port_vaddr(p)` |
  | `PORT_U32_TO_PTR(T, v)` | `reinterpret_cast<T>(v)` / `(T)(v)` | `reinterpret_cast<T>(port_hptr(v))` | `(T)port_hptr(v)` |
  | `PORT_STORE_PTR32(slot, p)` | `slot = PORT_PTR_TO_U32(p)` | same | same |
  | `PORT_RES_PTR_WRAPPED` | 0 | 1 | 1 |

  A relocated file in host memory is the Wii image of that file: every slot holds the
  big-endian address the Wii would have stored, for a buffer at the same emulated address.
- **ResFont.** `Rebuild` calls `ResolveOffset<T>(slot, pHeader)` on each slot. On the host the
  overload in `ut_ResFont.cpp` stores `pBase + (s32)slot.raw()` through `operator=`. All readers
  in `ut_ResFontBase.cpp` compile unchanged. The second load of an `RFNU` buffer finds FINF and
  reads the slots as addresses, exactly as on the Wii.
- **Warnings.** `-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast` (C and C++) and `-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast` (C)
  make every narrowing cast between pointers and integers a build error; in C++
  `reinterpret_cast<u32>(ptr)` already is one on LP64. Together with the layout checks (§7) these
  are the checklist for the remaining `POINTERS.md` sites.

## 6. `wchar_t` and BMG text

- **16-bit `wchar_t`.** Everything in the host build, decomp and host code alike, is compiled with
  `-fshort-wchar -include port/wide.h`. `port/wide.h` `static_assert`s `sizeof(wchar_t) == 2`
  (C and C++), includes the C library's `<wchar.h>`/`<cwchar>` first so their declarations are
  seen under the real names, declares `port_wcslen`, `port_wcscpy`, `port_wcsncpy`,
  `port_wcscmp`, `port_wcschr`, `port_wmemcpy` and `port_wmemchr`, and `#define`s the plain names
  to them. The definitions are the decompiled `src/MSL_C/wstring.c` and `wmem.c`, compiled
  unmodified with `-DPORT_WIDE_IMPL` (which skips the libc include, so the macros rename the MSL
  definitions) and `-idirafter include/MSL` (for `<internal/wstring.h>`). `swprintf` and
  `vswprintf` (`src/MSL_C/wprintf.c`) are not routed yet: they need the MSL locale tables and
  `__num2dec`; add them with the first unit that formats text. Never pass a `wchar_t` string to a
  libc wide function.
- **BMG text byte order.** `PortSwapBmgText(void*)` (`src/host_text.cpp`, declared in
  `port/host.h`) swaps the DAT1 text of a loaded BMG to host order once. It follows each INF1
  entry's string, swaps code units, swaps the `0x001A` tag mark, leaves the tag's length, group,
  id and parameter bytes as in the file, and marks what it has done so shared strings are
  swapped once. `EGG::MsgRes::analyzeTag` reads the length byte directly (unchanged) and group
  and id with `port_load_be32` on the host. Call it after loading and before constructing
  `RPSysMessage`; the Phase 7 loader will call it where the game creates `RPSysMessage`
  (for example `RPTnkLyt`, `RPDucHud`, `RPBomLyt`, `RPPnpGame`, `RPHkyGame`).
  BRLYT `txt1` strings are converted by `lyt::TextBox` when it copies them (§4).

## 7. Layout checks

`tests/layout_asserts.cpp` (`test_layout`) holds `static_assert(sizeof(...))` and
`offsetof(...)` checks, taken from the `// at 0xNN` comments in the headers, for every struct
moved to `be_*`/`RES_PTR` so far: `BinaryFileHeader`, `BinaryBlockHeader`, `CharWidths`,
`FontTextureGlyph`, `FontWidth`, `FontCodeMap`, `FontInformation`, the `EGG::MsgRes` block
structs (checked from a derived class because they are protected), `RPSysMessage::Entry`, the
four TPL structs, the `lyt::res` blocks and value types (`AnimationTarget`, `StepKey` and
`HermiteKey` are local to `lyt_animation.cpp`; the layout harness covers them), and
`ut::Color`. It also checks that DAT1 text elements are 2 bytes. The decomp's `TPL.h` comments
`TPLClutHeader.unpacked` as `at 0x1`; it is at 0x2 (after the `u16`), on the Wii too. The checks run when the file compiles, in both
the 64-bit and `-m32` builds. Add a block for each struct that moves to the wrapper types.

## 8. Next steps

- `POINTERS.md` step 5 (g3d). It also makes `RPPlayerNameTag.cpp` build in the 64-bit host
  build: `g3d_obj.h` and `eggCpuTexture.h` cast pointers to `u32`.
- Drawing layouts needs the Phase 7 GX layer behind `src/host_gx.cpp`, and the
  `nw4r::math` inline-assembly helpers: `math_arithmetic.h` `FAbs` (and others written as
  `register` + asm) return an uninitialised value on the host, because `ASM(...)` compiles away.
  Nothing on the build/bind path calls them.
- Move the next loaders onto `be_*` as they are brought up. Each needs the type declarations, a
  small number of C `BE_GET`s, a `layout_asserts.cpp` block and a `check_matching.py` run:
  - `g3d::Res*Data`
  - `ef` headers
  - `snd` file structs
- Route `swprintf`/`vswprintf` to `src/MSL_C/wprintf.c` (§6) when the first caller is built.
- Replace `src/host_sdk.cpp` with the Phase 7 OS/DVD/heap layer: real threads, message queues
  that block, and MEM heaps (the decomp's `src/revolution/MEM` could compile as-is once the OS
  layer exists), carved from the M0 arena.

## 9. TPL and layouts

- **TPL.** `port/host/include/revolution/TPL/TPL.h` shadows the SDK header: the scalar fields
  are `be_*`, the GX enum fields `BE_ENUM(E, u32)`, and the five pointer slots
  (`descriptorArray`, `textureHeader`, `CLUTHeader`, both `data`) `RES_PTR`. `revolution/TPL.h`
  includes it inside `extern "C"`, so it pulls in the wrapper headers under `extern "C++"`.
  `src/host_tpl.cpp` is `TPLBind`/`TPLGet` with the algorithm of `src/revolution/TPL/TPL.c`
  (same order, the same `unpacked` guards), storing `palette + offset` through `RES_PTR`, i.e.
  as M0 addresses: a bound palette is the Wii image of the palette, and `TexMap::Set`'s test
  `PORT_PTR_TO_U32(descriptorArray) < 0x80000000` (the raw slot value) works on every host.
  The decomp's `TPL.c` is not compiled on the host (its casts through `u32` cannot be expressed
  with the wrapper in C); image and palette bytes stay GX-native.
- **Layout resource structs.** Every integer and float field that the CPU reads from a BRLYT or
  BRLAN is `be_*` (§4). Fields that are copied into runtime objects whole (`math::VEC2/VEC3`,
  `Size`, `TexSRT`, `GXColorS10`, `InflationLRTB`, texture coordinates) have a `res::` file type
  on the host that converts on copy, and are the runtime type itself on the Wii. Fields of one
  byte (most material GX state) are unchanged and copied as bytes. Colours stored as `u32`
  (vertex and text colours) go through `ut::Color`'s `be_u32` view. The animation keys are read
  big-endian on every `Animate`, so the file is never swapped or rewritten.

## 10. Hard-coded runtime offsets (POINTERS.md step 4)

- **`RPSysTagProcessor.cpp` (message tag `0x20002`).** Was
  `*reinterpret_cast<bool*>(reinterpret_cast<u32>(RPSysSystemWinMgr::instance()) + idx + 0xD4)`.
  Now `reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(instance()) + idx + offsetof(RPSysSystemWinMgr, mSeType)`:
  the same sum, with the member named and the address in an integer as wide as a pointer. On
  the Wii `uintptr_t` and `size_t` are `unsigned long` and `offsetof` is `0xD4`, so CodeWarrior
  emits the same code (the natural `instance()->mSeType[idx] = true` still swaps registers, so
  the NONMATCHING-DEBT note stays). `RPSysSystemWinMgr` declares `RPSysTagProcessor` a friend
  for the `offsetof` of the private member. No `#if`; the unit compiles in both host builds
  (`make` builds its object).
- **`RPPlayerNameTag.cpp` (the Mii name of each player).** Was
  `reinterpret_cast<const wchar_t*>(reinterpret_cast<u32>(pHeads[mPlayer]) + 0x68)`, i.e.
  `RPSysAvatar::mAdditionalInfo.name`. The Wii build cannot include the class (its header chain
  adds g3d data this unit does not have), so the host form sits in `#if defined(PORT_HOST)`:
  `pParams->pHeads[mPlayer]->mAdditionalInfo.name`, with `RPKokeshiMgr.h` (the
  `RPKokeshiHead` definition) included under the same guard. The Wii branch is the original line.
  It compiles in the `-m32` host build; the 64-bit build waits for the g3d headers (§8).
